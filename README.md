# Getting Captain working with Jest

Starting from a [simple workflow that runs jest][workflow-before-captain], we want to

1. üß™ Ensure jest produces json output

`jest --json --outputFile tmp/jest.json` will produce captain-compatible json output in `tmp/jest.json`. We get useful
location information if you also include `--testLocationInResults`

```sh
npm test -- --json --testLocationInResults --outputFile tmp/jest.json
```

2. üîê Create an API token

Create an API token for your organization within [captain][captain], ([more documentation here][create-api-token]).
The token needs write access.

Add the new token as an action secret to your repository. Conventionally, we call this secret `CAPTAIN_API_TOKEN`.

3. üíå Add a step to upload to captain

```yaml
- name: Upload test results to Captain # optional, shows in github action results
  uses: rwx-research/upload-captain-artifact@v1
  if: always() # run even if build fails
  continue-on-error: true # if upload to captain fails, don't fail the build
  with:
    artifacts: |
      [
        {
          "name": "Jest",
          "path": "tmp/jest.json",
          "kind": "test_results",
          "parser": "jest_json"
        }
      ]
    captain-token: '${{ secrets.CAPTAIN_API_TOKEN }}'
```

4. üéâ See your test results in Captain!
